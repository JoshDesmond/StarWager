Project Context:

I am building an application, StarStake, which will enable tournament and event organizers for competitive games to run ante style tournaments. The MVP application will be centered around a single tournament, "The Ascension". Each party attendee will download the Android or iOS application on their phone, verify their identity using their phone number, and receive 1000 StarCredits to start.

Player Features:
- As a player, I want to:
  - Set my display name for identification
  - View my current token count and tournament standing
  - See the leaderboard to compare myself with others
  - View other tournament participants to identify potential opponents
  - View my match history and win/loss record to track performance
  - Challenge other players to matches with custom token wagers
  - Receive, accept, or decline challenge requests from others
  - Be notified of challenge status updates (accepted/declined)
  - Report match results when I win
  - Confirm or dispute results reported by opponents
  - Receive notifications about match result confirmations or disputes

Host Administrative Features:
- As a host, I want to:
  - Create, start, and end events
  - Set a tournament name for identification
  - Invite players via URL links
  - Monitor all players and their current status (in match, ready, away)
  - Remove players if necessary
  - View and resolve disputed matches to ensure fair play
