Project Context:

I am building an application, StarStake, which will enable tournament and event organizers for competitive games to run ante style tournaments. The MVP application will be centered around a single tournament, "The Ascension". Each party attendee will download the Android or iOS application on their phone, automatically join the tournament, and receive 1000 StarCredits to start.

Player Features:
- As a player, I want to:
  - Set my display name for identification
  - View my current token count and tournament standing
  - See the leaderboard to compare myself with others
  - View other tournament participants to identify potential opponents
  - View my match history and win/loss record to track performance
  - Challenge other players to matches with custom token wagers
  - Receive, accept, or decline challenge requests from others
  - Be notified of challenge status updates (accepted/declined)
  - Report match results when I win
  - Confirm or dispute results reported by opponents
  - Receive notifications about match result confirmations or disputes

Host Administrative Features:
- As a host, I want to:
  - Create, start, and end events
  - Set a tournament name for identification
  - Invite players via URL links
  - Monitor all players and their current status (in match, ready, away)
  - Remove players if necessary
  - View and resolve disputed matches to ensure fair play
